Awachie Benjamin Amarachi — Personal Website

Welcome to my first personal website — built entirely on my mobile phone using raw HTML and CSS. This project is more than just code; it’s a reflection of my passion for web development, creativity, and the determination to build something meaningful from scratch.

🚀 What This Site Includes
- A smooth-scrolling, multi-section layout  
- Hero section with my image and name  
- About Me, Gallery, and Contact sections  
- Stylish design with animations and responsive elements

📱 Why It Matters
I created this site as part of my journey into tech — learning, experimenting, and sharing my progress with the world. It’s proof that you don’t need fancy tools or expensive gear to start building. Just a phone, a dream, and a little code.
